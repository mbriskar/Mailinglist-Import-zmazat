============
 To-do List
============

 NOTE: system properties should be
 added to allow suppression of metadata and dual
 folder content support. This is to allow for direct
 access to an existing mbox store with a guarantee
 that the filesystem will not be modified in a
 way that is incompatible with traditional mbox
 implementations.

 - Work on memory-management features including
 caching and smart loading of message content
 
 - Implement updating of message headers in the mbox file.
