0.9.8:

 - Added option for disabling java.nio direct buffers
 
 - Added support for user flags containing spaces

 - Added Tags support for messages (user flags)

0.9.7:

 - Added assertions to MStorFolder
 
 - Updated checkstyle configuration and clean up
 
 - Added event broadcasting for opened, closed, created, deleted and renamed
 folders
 
 - Added event broadcasting for messages added or removed from a folder
 
 
0.9.6:

 - Fixed bug introduced in 0.9.5 causing message reads from incorrect postion
 in mbox file.
 
 - Fixed date lines (message headers, metadata) to US-specific locale
 
 - Removed invalid tag from maven project descriptor
 
 - Now throws FolderNotFoundException when opening a folder that doesn't exist
 
 - Fixed appendMessages() retrieval of metadata
 
 
0.9.5:

 - Provided system properties to configure the use of java.nio mapping and caching
 (see README for details).
 
 - Folders automatically closed when underlying store is closed.
 
 - Fixed unit tests to correctly release resources (i.e. close the mbox file)
 
 - File encoding defaults to "ISO-8859-1" again (may be overridden with system
 property).
 
 - Restored compatibility with Java 1.4.
 

0.9.4:

 - Reimplemented aspects of MboxFile to reduce the amount of encoding/decoding
 performed. Now decoding is only used to determine message positions and check
 for existing "From_" lines. Message data is now returned in raw byte format.
 Encoding is now only used for adding "From_" lines to appended messages, with
 message data written in raw bytes.
 
 - Added system property "mstor.mbox.encoding" to specify a non-default file
 encoding.
 
 - Removed functionality to strip "From " escaping when returning messages. It
 seems that this cannot be performed reliably (various references on the Web)
 and until confirmed otherwise I thought it best to disable this feature.
 
 - Improved memory performance in MstorFolder.appendMessages(): messages passed
 to this method are now garbage collected on the fly to allow for very large
 messages to be copied without running out of heap space.


0.9.3:

 - Added validation of mbox files to MStorFolder.list()
 
 - Support for headers in metadata. This has some implications:
 
 	* metadata is only created for existing mailboxes if its
 	contents are changed (i.e. headers, flags, etc.)
 	
 	* if metadata exists, headers are read from metadata in an
 	attempt to delay loading of the entire message
 	
 	* all headers are currently save which means the metadata
 	file can get quite large. Will review this at a later date
 	
 - metadata reworked to use message number as identifier as opposed
 to message id. This means that:
 
    * the message content no longer requires loading to get the
    message id and obtain the metadata (sort of defeated the purpose
    previously..)
 
    * non-MIME messages can now save metadata (MIME messages don't
    have a message id)
    
    * when messages are expunged other messages' metadata must have their
    message numbers updated to stay in synch with the folder
 
 - Added error handling to MboxFile to "fall back" on using a random access
 file where java.nio fails. This seems to occur on Windows 98 consistently.
 

0.9.2_01:

 - Recompiled with JDK 1.4.2 for compatibility with pre-1.5 JVM


0.9.2:

 - Added patches to MboxFile.purge() and MstorFolder.expunge()
 to work on Unix/Linux - provided by Paul Legato
 
 - Added fix to mask/unmask patterns in message content that
 match the "From_" line pattern - provided by Michael G. Kaiser
 
 - From_ line now specifies date message is appended to the
 mbox file (rather than "1 Jan 1970")
 
 - Added support for folders that hold both messages and subfolders
 
 
0.9.1:

 - Improved meta-data implementation
 
 
0.9:

 - Initial Release
 
 - Reading from/appending to mbox files
 
 - Basic message caching
